## Class 1 – Introduction to Degrowth: what is it and where does it come from?

### What is Degrowth? From an Activist Slogan to a Social Movement

* voluntary societal shrinking of production and consumption aimed at social and ecological sustainability
* degrowth does not aspire to be adopted as a common goal by the United Nations, the OECD or the European Commission. The idea of ‘socially sustainable degrowth’ (Schneider et al. 2010), or simply degrowth, was born as a proposal for radical change
* degrowth is a critique of the current development hegemony
* degrowth actors ind the economic system based on growth (fuelled by debt) as the core problem
* does not embrace one single philosophical current

*Ecology*
Ecosystems as having value in themselves
Stresses the competition between ecosystems and the industrial production and consumption systems
Degrowth is therefore a possible path to preserve ecosystems by the reduction of human pressure over ecosystems and
nature, and a challenge to the idea that decoupling of ecological impacts from
economic growth is possible

*Critiques of development and praise for anti-utilitarianism*
Critique of the uniformisation of cultures due to the widespread adoption of particular technologies and consumption and production models experienced in the global North

critique of homo economicus, against utility-maximisation as the ultimate driving force of human behaviour.

Degrowth in that sense calls for more ample visions giving importance to economic relations based on gifts and reciprocity, where social relations and conviviality are central

*Meaning of life and well-being*

Voluntary simplicity, reducing individual consumption while seeing simple life as liberating and profound rather than restraining and limiting is an important vision within this source

*Bioeconomics*

For Georgescu, human activity transforms energy and materials of low entropy or good quality into waste and pollution which are unusable and have
high entropy. Even the inlow of low-entropy solar energy is limited in the
sense that it falls in a dispersed fashion on the earth. Degrowth can thus slow
down the process of material degradation

The bioeconomic arguments for degrowth, including the decreasing energy
return on investment and the imminent peak oil,14 are often cited in academic
and political debate

While technological innovation is a source of debate in
degrowth, all degrowth actors question the capacity of technological innovation to overcome biophysical limits and sustain ininite economic growth.

Degrowth dwells on many ‘non-technical’
proposals for reducing material and energy lows outside the modernisation approach which tends to discard the option of setting some limits to technologies

*Democracy*

Response to the lack of democratic debates on economic development, growth, technological innovation and advancement

It is a open debate whether current institutions ought to be kept

*Justice*

It intentionally pursues and explores ways to make justice and sustainability compatible.

Degrowth opts for less competition, large scale redistribution, sharing and reduction of excessive incomes. If poverty is perceived in terms of relative consumption, it can never be ‘eradicated’ by economic growth as it only changes the scale but not the proportions of wealth which individuals possess

Justice requires a degrowth of the living standards of the rich classes of the North and South

Repairing past injustice. A good illustration is the concept of ecological debt, or the demand that the Global North pays for past
and present colonial exploitation in the Global South

There is an ongoing debate of the amount of acceptable inequality and the means to achieve more equality and dignity.

### Kallis what is degrowth?

Experts accumulate power at the expense of
people. Illich’s slogan was that socialism can then only arrive by bicycle. A
complex technological system cannot be democratic or egalitarian

# Class Notes 2nd November 2022
-> We cover our understanding of degrowth, which different focus but pretty harmonic understanding of its contributions to the current paradigm of growthism
-> Key point and the reason to study degrowth: our crisis have a political dimension, and as such, is political ecology the academic 

**What is Degrowth - summary from Giorgios Kallis

A critique of the desirability of economic growth. It is a slogan that challenges the hegemony of growth.
