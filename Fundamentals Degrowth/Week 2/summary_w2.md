### Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality

CHAPTER TWO
Race, Class, and the Politics of Place

The South in this latter period was undergoing a number of dramatic demographic. economic, and ecological changes. It had become a major growth center.

Growth in the region during the 1970s was stimulated by a number of factors. They included (12) a climate pleasant enough to attract workers from other regions and the "underemployed" workforce already in the region, (2) weak labor unions and strong right-to-work laws, (3) cheap labor and cheap land, (4) attractive areas for new industries, i.e., electronics, federal defense, and aerospace contracting, (5) aggressive self-promotion and booster campaigns. and (6) lenient environmental regulations

it promoted as important for a "good business climate," including "low business taxes, a good infrastructure of municipal services, vigorous law enforcement, an eager and docile labor force, and a minimum of business regulations

economic boosters could usually count on their promise of jobs as an efficient strategy of neutralizing local opposition to growth projects

people do not speak of growth as useful to profits---rather, they speak of it as necessary for making jobs

Those communities that failed to penetrate the clean industry market were left with a choice of dirty industry or no industry at all. These disparities typify the changing industrial pattern in the South.

The South also has the largest concentration of blacks in the country. In 1980, more than 14 million blacks lived in the region. Blacks were nearly one-fifth of the region's population. In the 1970s the region's black population increased by nearly 18 percent.

*Consequences of Uneven Development*

Migrants to urban areas and incumbent residents who had marginal skills generally found themselves in the growing unemployment lines

Growth in the urban South heightened status differences between rich and poor and between blacks and whites. Poverty coexisted amid affluence. Poverty, however, represented a source of cheap labor.

The New South was promoted as a changed land where blacks could now share in the American Dream. Fuller argued that "power has not changed hands in the South, not from white hands to black hands."[12] What is "new" about an area where blacks are systematically denied access to jobs, housing, and other residential amenities?

Black communities still suffer from institutionalized discrimination. Discriminatory practices occur at various levels of government and affect the location of polling places, municipal landfills, and toxic-waste dumps.

There were twenty-three blacks in the U.S. Congress in 1989. This number represented only 5.3 percent of the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. There were no blacks in the U.S. Senate.

Until these policysetting institutions are made more inclusive, we are likely to find an intensification of locational conflicts and charges of racial discrimination.




*Endangered Environs*

Many black workers must settle for nearby manufacturing jobs---the ones that have not moved out of the inner city. Because of their proximity to polluting industries, black communities have the most to gain from effective environmental enforcement mechanisms.

Social justice, political empowerment, equal education, fair employment practices, and open housing were major goals of social justice advocates. It was one thing to talk about "saving trees" and a whole different story when one talked about "saving low-income housing" for the poor.

Decent and affordable housing became a more salient issue than the traditional environmental issues. Similarly, unemployment and poverty were more pressing social problems for African Americans than any of the issues voiced by middleclass environmentalists.

In their desperate attempt to improve the economic conditions of their constituents, many civil rights advocates, business leaders, and political officials directed their energies toward bringing jobs to their communities by relaxing enforcement of pollution standards and environmental regulations and sometimes looking the other way when violations were discovered. In many instances, the creation of jobs resulted in health risks to workers and residents of the surrounding communities.

Polluting industries were brought into poor communities with little input from local community leaders.[23] When questions were raised by concerned citizens. the argument of jobs for local residents was used to quell dissent. Jobs were real; environmental risks were unknown.
