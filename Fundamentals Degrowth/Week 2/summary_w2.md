### Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality

CHAPTER TWO
Race, Class, and the Politics of Place

The South in this latter period was undergoing a number of dramatic demographic. economic, and ecological changes. It had become a major growth center.

Growth in the region during the 1970s was stimulated by a number of factors. They included (12) a climate pleasant enough to attract workers from other regions and the "underemployed" workforce already in the region, (2) weak labor unions and strong right-to-work laws, (3) cheap labor and cheap land, (4) attractive areas for new industries, i.e., electronics, federal defense, and aerospace contracting, (5) aggressive self-promotion and booster campaigns. and (6) lenient environmental regulations

it promoted as important for a "good business climate," including "low business taxes, a good infrastructure of municipal services, vigorous law enforcement, an eager and docile labor force, and a minimum of business regulations

economic boosters could usually count on their promise of jobs as an efficient strategy of neutralizing local opposition to growth projects

people do not speak of growth as useful to profits---rather, they speak of it as necessary for making jobs

Those communities that failed to penetrate the clean industry market were left with a choice of dirty industry or no industry at all. These disparities typify the changing industrial pattern in the South.

The South also has the largest concentration of blacks in the country. In 1980, more than 14 million blacks lived in the region. Blacks were nearly one-fifth of the region's population. In the 1970s the region's black population increased by nearly 18 percent.



*Consequences of Uneven Development*

Migrants to urban areas and incumbent residents who had marginal skills generally found themselves in the growing unemployment lines

Growth in the urban South heightened status differences between rich and poor and between blacks and whites. Poverty coexisted amid affluence. Poverty, however, represented a source of cheap labor.

The New South was promoted as a changed land where blacks could now share in the American Dream. Fuller argued that "power has not changed hands in the South, not from white hands to black hands."[12] What is "new" about an area where blacks are systematically denied access to jobs, housing, and other residential amenities?

Black communities still suffer from institutionalized discrimination. Discriminatory practices occur at various levels of government and affect the location of polling places, municipal landfills, and toxic-waste dumps. 

Black communities still suffer from institutionalized discrimination. Discriminatory practices occur at various levels of government and affect the location of polling places, municipal landfills, and toxic-waste dumps. 

There were twenty-three blacks in the U.S. Congress in 1989. This number represented only 5.3 percent of the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. There were no blacks in the U.S. Senate.

Until these policysetting institutions are made more inclusive, we are likely to find an intensification of locational conflicts and charges of racial discrimination.




*Endangered Environs*

Many black workers must settle for nearby manufacturing jobs---the ones that have not moved out of the inner city. Because of their proximity to polluting industries, black communities have the most to gain from effective environmental enforcement mechanisms.

Social justice, political empowerment, equal education, fair employment practices, and open housing were major goals of social justice advocates. It was one thing to talk about "saving trees" and a whole different story when one talked about "saving low-income housing" for the poor.

Decent and affordable housing became a more salient issue than the traditional environmental issues. Similarly, unemployment and poverty were more pressing social problems for African Americans than any of the issues voiced by middleclass environmentalists.

In their desperate attempt to improve the economic conditions of their constituents, many civil rights advocates, business leaders, and political officials directed their energies toward bringing jobs to their communities by relaxing enforcement of pollution standards and environmental regulations and sometimes looking the other way when violations were discovered. In many instances, the creation of jobs resulted in health risks to workers and residents of the surrounding communities.

Polluting industries were brought into poor communities with little input from local community leaders.[23] When questions were raised by concerned citizens. the argument of jobs for local residents was used to quell dissent. Jobs were real; environmental risks were unknown.

Many industrial firms especially waste disposal companies and industries that have a long history of pollution violations, came to view the black community as a "pushover lacking community organization, environmental consciousness, and with strong and blind pro-business politics."

Because a large share of inhabitants in these communities are renters (many from low-income households) rather than home owners, it is difficult to organize and mobilize residents. This marginality also makes it hard for people to donate their time or money to fend off threats to the community.

*Growing Black Militancy*

Blacks did not launch a frontal assault on environmental problems affecting their communities until these issues were couched in a civil rights context beginning in the early 1980s. They began to treat their struggle for environmental equity as a struggle against institutionalized racism and an extension of the quest for social justice.[37] Just as black citizens fought for equal education, employment, and housing, they began to include the opportunity to live in a healthy environment as part of their basic rights. Moreover, they were convinced that disparate enforcement of environmental policies and regulations contributes to neighborhood decline much like housing discrimination, redlining practices, and residential segregation do.

The site at Afton was not even scientifically the most suitable. The water table of Afton, North Carolina, (site of the landfill) is only 5-10 feet below the surface, and the residents of the community derive all of their drinking water from local wells. Only the most optimistic could believe that the Afton landfill will not eventually leach into the groundwater. The depositing of toxic wastes within the black community is no less than attempted genocide.

Landfilling is cheap. It is cheaper than the alternative. The people who like to use landfills such as chemical industries are very powerful. No amount of science, truth, knowledge or facts goes into making this decision. It is a purely political decision. What they listen to is pressure.


**Waste Facilily Siting Disparities**

The facility siting controversy cannot be reduced solely to a class phenomenon because there is no shortage of poor white communities in the region. One only has to point to southern Appalachia to see widespread white poverty in America. Nevertheless, poor whites along with their more afiluent counterparts have more options and leveraging mechanisms (formal and informal) at their disposal than blacks of equal status.

Nationally, three of the five largest commercial hazardous-waste landfills are located in areas where blacks and Hispanics compose a majority of the population. These siting disparities expose minority citizens to greater risks than the general population.

Growing empirical evidence shows that toxic-waste dumps, municipal landfills, garbage incinerators, and similar noxious facilities are not randomly scattered across the American landscape. The siting process has resulted in minority neighborhoods (regardless of class) carrying a greater burden of localized costs than either affluent or poor white neighborhoods. Differential access to power and decision making found among black and white communities also institutionalizes siting disparities.

Finally, the burden, or negative side, of industrial development has not been equally distributed across all segments of the population. Living conditions in many communities have not improved very much with new growth. Black communities became the dumping grounds for various types of unpopular facilities, including toxic wastes, dangerous chemicals, paper mills, and other polluting industries.

A political strategy is also needed that can draw from a wide cross-section of individuals and groups who share a common interest in preservation of environmental standards. In his keynote address to the 1983 Urban Environment Conference on toxics and minorities, Congressman John Conyers of Detroit pinpointed this strategy. The black congressman saw broad-based groups (e.g., similar to those attending the New Orleans meeting) as having an "opportunity to raise the fairness issue in all dimensions, including the toxic threat to the poor, minority and working class Americans."

# From the ground up : intro and chapter 1

Cole, Luke W., and Sheila R. Foster, 2001. Introduction and Chapter 1 in From the Ground Up:
Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement. New York: New York
University Press, 2001, pp. 10-33.


https://jasonwmoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cole-and-Foster-From-the-Ground-Up_-Environmental-Racism-and-the-Rise-of-the-Environmental-Justice-Movement-2001-NYU-Press.pdf


Environmental hazards are inequitably distributed in the United States, with poor people and people of color bearing a greater share of pollution
than richer people and white people.

However, since so much of environmental decision making is structured by legal institutions, it is important to understand the way in which environmental laws can both contribute to and mitigate the injustice experienced by many communities.

Understanding environmental racism and injustice requires a broader, structural perspective. This broader perspective, what we call the “political economy”
of environmental racism, is crucial both to framing the issue and to addressing the injustice so many communities experience.

This broader analysis, in turn, forces us to go beyond framing the problem as merely a distributive one—certain communities get an unfair environmental burden—
and to reconceptualize grassroots activism as more than an attempt to disrupt the decisions of private corporations and state agencies. Instead,
grassroots struggles are a crucial arena in which to restructure social relations through systems of localized environmental decision making.

A private company or government official has made the decision to locate an environmentally hazardous facility in their neighborhood.
These processes also involve a community’s decision to organize and become involved in the decisions that shape its lives and health.

**Transformative Politics**

What is “new” about the Environmental Justice Movement is not the “elevated environmental consciousness” of its members but the ways that it transforms the possibilities for fundamental social and environmental change through redefinition, reinvention, and construction of innovative political and cultural
discourses and practices.

Individuals are transformed through the process of struggle by learning about, and participating in, a decision that will fundamentally affect their quality of life. Using lawyers and other technicians, residents in embattled communities both build upon their knowledge of their community’s environmental problems and acquire knowledge about the substantive and procedural aspects of environmental decision making. Their home-grown, and acquired, expertise empowers local residents and helps them to develop a grassroots base to influence environmental decision making.

Environmental justice groups are networking with other groups to provide information and technical expertise to grassroots constituencies on various issues of interest to disenfranchised communities, beyond environmental justice. Because of these networks, residents in marginal communities will continue to shape environmental policy, both locally and nationally, as well as create more opportunities for community input into the spectrum of policy making that affects their material conditions.

**Words Have Power: A Note on Our Terminology**

“environmental racism” and “environmental injustice” interchangeably in the book. While “environmental racism” is the better-known term, “environmental injustice” is broader and encompasses both the racial and the class aspects of the political economy at work in communities that face toxic assault.

Environmental justice requires democratic decision making, community empowerment, and the incorporation of social structure.

Most important in our concept of environmental justice is the element of democratic decision making, or community self-determination. Current environmental decision-making processes have not been effective in providing meaningful participation opportunities for those most burdened by environmental decisions.

Historically, poor communities of color have been marginalized within the environmental movement. These communities view traditional environmentalism as associated with the preservation of wildlife and wilderness—concerns that are just not central to the everyday survival of poor communities and communities of color.


**A Final Note: The Focus on Waste**

The movement for environmental justice seeks much more than merely to stop the siting of waste facilities, and other locally undesirable land uses
in low-income communities and communities of color. Waste facility siting battles are but one aspect of the movement for environmental justice,
which also concerns itself with the cleanup of contaminated industrial sites, the elimination of occupational hazards, lead abatement, enforcement of existing environmental regulations, and the guarantee of representation in the environmental decision-making process.

The movement for environmental justice is also about creating clean jobs, building a sustainable economy, guaranteeing safe and affordable housing, and achieving racial and social justice.

Waste facility siting is also the arena in which a great deal of grassroots action takes place. It is no coincidence that some of the first major environmental justice studies to chart disproportionate impact focused on commercial waste facilities. These facilities can pose great risk to human health and the environment and are the subject of ongoing public scrutiny and concern.

# A History of the Environmental Justice Movement

Perhaps the most significant source feeding into today’s Environmental
Justice Movement is the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s, 1960s,
and 1970s. Through that movement, hundreds of thousands of African
Americans and their allies, primarily but not solely in the southern
United States, pressed for social change and experienced empowerment
through grassroots activism

Environmental Justice Movement leaders coming out of civil rights
organizing include not only those who advocated for the rights of
African Americans but also Latino activists. 

Civil rights activists brought three things to the Environmental Justice Movement: a history of, and experience with, direct action, which
led to similar exercises of grassroots power by the Environmental Justice
Movement; a perspective that recognized that the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards was not random or the result of “neutral”
decisions but a product of the same social and economic structure which
had produced de jure and de facto segregation and other racial oppression; and the experience of empowerment through political action


1960s, introduced the Environmental Justice Act.8
Though the Act did not pass Congress, it raised environmental justice issues to a new stature in Washington. Lewis, in speaking about the bill,
recognized that “the quest for environmental justice has helped to renew
the civil rights movement” through its call for environmental protection
as a “right of all, not a privilege for a few

The second major tributary to the river is the grassroots anti-toxics
movement. Communities have long resisted and organized against hazardous waste facilities, landfills, and incinerators.

 Growing out of their concrete experiences in their own communities, anti-toxics activists came up with the
idea of “pollution prevention”—that is, eliminating the use of toxic
chemicals in industrial practices so that the production of toxic waste
is stopped as well. 

the Environmental Justice Movement. It further contributed both the experience of
using (and, when need be, discrediting) scientific and technical information and the conceptual framework that pushed pollution prevention and
toxics use reduction as policy goals.

**Academics**

Academics,
however, have played a crucial role in both sparking and shaping the Environmental Justice Movement, perhaps a larger one than they have
played in any other broad-based social movement in the United States

Beyond lobbying the federal government, the academics researched
and wrote (and continue to produce) studies that demonstrate the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color and
on low-income people.

the academics have provided expertise to community
groups during litigation or administrative advocacy in a local environmental justice struggle

the academics learned from community
residents the situation on the ground, while local residents came to understand their community’s struggle in the context of a larger regional
or national pattern and movement


**Native American Struggles**
Native American activists brought to the Environmental Justice
Movement the experiences of centuries of struggle for self-determination and resistance to resource-extractive land use.


The Native American tributary to the movement also helped define
one of its central philosophies, the concept of self-determination. The
centuries-old Native American idea of sovereignty echoed with, and
helped create, the Environmental Justice Movement’s credo, “We speak
for ourselves.”

**The Labor Movement**

the historical struggle of farm-workers to gain control over their
working conditions. The farm-worker movement of the 1960s, led by
Cesar Chavez, was perhaps the first nationally known effort by people
of color to address an environmental issue. Much of the activity took
the form of union organizing drives.

Unionization and protection of
farm-workers’ health and safety were integrally linked from the earliest
days of the farm-worker organizing drives

A second, and much less significant, labor tributary, one fed by the
public health activism of the 1970s, is the occupational safety and health
movement. The rise of Committees on Occupational Safety and Health
(COSHs) across the country in the 1970s and 1980s brought increased
attention to the environmental hazards faced by workers in the workplace.

A third labor tributary is the increased attention paid to occupational
safety and health by industrial unions. Led by sometimes renegade union
activists such as Tony Mazzochi, unions such as the Oil, Chemical, and
Atomic Workers Union have paid increased attention to environmental
justice issues. 

Perhaps it is the history of
the traditional environmental movement that has made it such a small
contributor to the Environmental Justice Movement.

The first wave began around the turn of the century, when
John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, and other lovers of wilderness advocated the preservation of natural spaces in the United States

 preservationists, who advocate preserving
wilderness from humans, and the conservationists, who want to preserve
nature for human use through wise stewardship

These laws created complex administrative
processes that exclude most people who do not have training in the field
and necessitate specific technical expertise. The laws, while in some cases
successful in cleaning up the environment, have also had an unintended
consequence—the exclusion of those without expertise from much of
environmental decision making.

Lawsuits are now the primary, and sometimes the only,
strategy employed by traditional groups

Until relatively recently, the traditional environmental law community
has largely ignored environmental justice issues


**The Summit**

Unprecedented alliances were formed at the Summit, and participants
made conceptual linkages between seemingly different struggles, identifying common themes of racism and economic exploitation of people
and land. Many there came to understand their issues in the context of a
larger movement, and on a deeper level than before. Latinos saw the
racism African Americans had experienced and likened it to their own experiences; foes of toxic waste dumps understood the fights of those who
opposed uranium mining. The raised consciousness took place at a variety of levels: “Native Americans stressing a spiritual connection with the
environment were able to find a common ground with Christian African
Americans and Mexican Americans,” 

On a more tangible level, perhaps the most
important result of the Summit were the Principles of Environmental
Justice, seventeen principles agreed to by the delegates.

**Environmental Justice Activists**

grassroots activists are often fighting for their health and homes. Environmental justice activists usually have an immediate and material stake
in solving the environmental problems they confront; they realize the
hazards they face affect the communities where they live and may be sickening or even killing them or their children

Second, with respect to background, grassroots environmentalists are
largely, though not entirely, poor or working-class people. Many are people of color who come from communities that are disenfranchised from
most major societal institutions. Because of their backgrounds, these activists often have a distrust for the law and are often experienced in the
use of nonlegal strategies, such as protest and other direct action.

Most environmental justice activists have a social justice orientation, seeing environmental degradation as just one of many ways their communities are
under attack. Because of their experiences, grassroots activists often lose
faith in government agencies and elected officials

Similarly, many activists also seek remedies that are more fundamental
than simply stopping a local polluter or toxic dumper. Instead, many
view the need for broader, structural reforms as a way to alleviate many
of the problems, including environmental degradation, that their communities endure


# Notes on Degrowth a la French (class notes)

The ask is not only economical, it is more fundamental,inviting one to shift and repolitize the terms in which economic relantions and identities are considered.

Degrowth is not an end, but rather a means for fostering a spirit of critique.

Degrowth propose to live the abudance of self limitation and frugality.

We need to decolonize our imaginary that justifices the westernizing violent process.

It is appropiate to use the colonization concept also to review and empower alternatives to growth.

The economy is an abstract idea, while having physical and real consequences is grounded on our minds and narratives

There is the false communication of economic laws, that only exists as long as we adhere to them and the regulators support them

The economy is an object of democratic choice, with no natural laws like in physics

Some degrowth defendors believe scaping the laws of nature to choose to live inside the limits of nature

Defendents of degrowth are not prepared to sacrificy democracy to live within planetary bounderies

Some colleagues consider the debate wrong as it implies a separation with nature, which is part of to care and thrive

# Anti-colonial movements and visions (class notes)

Surplus accumulation requires cheapen inputs, such as labor and nature.

Capitalism requires imperial relationships.

It took 500 years to get back to welfare ratios of 1400 due to social movements and working unions.

The availability of the commons for society was removed to push the working class to become docile labor.

The monoculture of certain crops like potatoes in ireland was driven to achieve cheap food to massives amount of labor.

Colonial imposition in India lead to starvation while massive exports of food was achieved.

Extreme poverty is a relative recent phenomenom, not an old phenomenon improved "thanks" to capitalism.

Contrary to typical narratives, India and China enjoyed better wellfare ration before colonialistic or state capitalistic dominance.

An arrangement of the north where imported cheap raw materials is exchange for expensive manufactured goods to the south perpetuates current observed inequality levels.

Colonialism and capitalism goes together, accumulation requires cheap labor and nature, and racist ideologies support such behaviours.

Racism, sexism, nature explotation are integrated and have a common root cause.

The new independent states remain controlled by autocratic elites who keep colonial power, and when Europe give up, US maintain this set up of colonization. 

US declared Latin america as a super colony, as long as they challenge their interests they will intervene. 

Only till 1955, there are an organized movement to overcome north domination. 

The rise of the south include: land reform, improve workers wages thanks to unions, invest i public services such as health and education, nationalizing key resources like oil. They also protect their domestic industries, avoid capital flight ...
and per capita income grew at 3.5% per year during 1950 and 1970.The non aligned movement, argued for fair global economy with real democracy in the UN.

We have examples in Iran, Guatemala, Congo, Allende of deposed leaders by US backed coups when those try to keep the ownership of the commons.

Despite this, the South still rises , creating for example OPEC for better prices of natural resource exports.

The first goal was to break with economic colonization. 


It was crashed by structural adjustment programs, to cut publci services in the south and make debt unpayable.  The thread of coups make default an impossible alternative. This was a tool to stop the strengthening of the south while giving new growth opportunities to the north. That rape alliances, and create a race to the bottom between the countries of the south to get investments and credit from the north.

Countries like US pick this system likely as it was the most productive system at the moment. The imperial implementation of restructuring programs increase incomes in US at the expense of th South. This rescue is called neoliberalism.

Why is it called liberalism? The actual system is capitalism, reframed to keep extracting incomes from the south.

Social democracy is possible without imperial arrangements. Surplus accumulation of capitalism and the organization of the economy for growth make very hard to keep social democracy without imperalism. Degrowth enable the implementation of social systems without imperialism.

**Volcker Shock** increase on interest rates to push debtors in the south. That pushes structural adjustment programs such as privatizations of public services. That was a blodless coup as it interferes directly with the sovereignity of countries without explicit violence.

This policy keep capita incomes in those countries to stagnate for at least 20 years. Two key instutitions are the World Bank and IMF are colonial institutions that enable that, where US holds veto and the G7 commans the majority of the vote.

The South did not default as the threat of coup was too great. Also, it is important to point out that IMF gives more vote to those that buy more shares, which is entirely democratic.

Capitalism was probably the most productive system to win the arms race, despite its requirements to erode internal democracy and break other countries.


# Types of environmentalism (class notes)

Originally, environmentalism was more known on groups that enter postmaterialism, those who can "afford" to neglect some income to focus on the protection of the environment. The Environmentalism of the poor claims that this is not a postmaterialism movement,but rather a mandate for social movements to protect the basis of their life systems. The environmentalism of the poor do not wait for sufficient "development" to happen before some countries of the south engage into environmentalism. 

Measurement is heavily critized by many environmentalism, particularly the ones from the poor, as it implies some centrality, lack of autonomy and democracy in the decisions. Sometimes measurements like cost benefit analysis are treated like neutral, while they are heavily political and back up by capitalistic mindsets.

Is cult of wilderness and colonization of certain natural spaces? What about the local communities that are there?

**Cult of wilderness** : protection of certain areas to keep them pristine and enjoy them only recreationally. What are the role of the local communities? Many local communities are already making a sustainable management of such spaces and make those spaces more resilient.

**Gospel of eco-efficiency** : Technology should allow us to keep exploting earth without significant health for humans and other living forms. 

**Environmentalism of the poor**: the movement more strongly tight with environmental justice.  Terms such as sacredness and sovereignity is different than the typical evaluation of the natural spaces made by wilderness protectionists or tecno optimists.

Open questions is:

1) Normally we think as environmental justices issues situations where central goverments impose to a local community a certain protect with negative environmental consequences with the justification of jobs... I would like to ask what does the literature said about projects where the local communities support the project, but the consequences are not only local but also global. Some examples I have in mind are the expansion of fast train projects in spain where the costs were cover by public expenses of the region. In general we can find many infraestructure projects that benefit little the middle class but as they are finance publicly and natinally they got significant support. What does political ecology says about such situations?

# Paper summary: The environmentalism of the Poor revisited: Territory and place in disconnected glocal struggles

The papers recontextualizes the book Environmentalism of the Poor in the current state of affairs, and the relevance of the three types of environmentalism : cult of wilderness (love of pristine nature and the expression of concerns
about contamination outside of its broader socio-economic and cultural framework), gospel of eco efficiency (the defense of a
wise use of natural resources, ecological modernization, ecotaxes, technological improvement, sustainable development, or smart cities, without considering the unavoidable environmental and health impacts of rapid industrialization) and the environmentalism of the poor ( have a material interest in the environment as a source and a requirement for livelihood and a preoccupation for today's historically marginalized residents).

The paper tries to correct the undeniable rural bias of the the book.


Activists engaged in environmental conflicts have built on their own local or transnational networks related to the themes or issues they are trying to address. Yet, these struggles embody common values and interests which often go beyond environmentalism itself.

Throughout our analysis, we show the role played by contestation as a way to remake place for historically marginalized
groups, re-assert cultural and traditional values and practices, and protect urban land both from contamination and dumping and private appropriation and speculation. This last point is especially important as previously contaminated land gets cleaned up and (re)developed, it often becomes the object of competition for uncontrolled growth and profit. Cities are places where uneven and often debilitating and damaging socio-natural relations of power work together through the
urbanization of nature. The production of urban nature is deeply political.

**Cult of Wilderness**

The preservation of pristine nature by setting aside natural areas from where humans and market values would
be excluded, and the active protection of wildlife for its ecological and esthetic values. Beautiful landscapes, threatened species, disappearing ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, tropical rainforests were and still are the main focus of this international movement.

One of the criticisms against this deep ecology movement is the failure of its adepts to consider the role of local people and involve them in the management of nature preserves. 

In many cases, people who have a stake and a local lay knowledge of sustainable natural management remain excluded from the protected areas.

The lack of economic valuation is deemed to cause the degradation of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. Nature is seen as ecosystems which have functions that become services to humans. Such services have no market value. It is possible nevertheless to give to them notional economic values. This will increase their visibility for public administrators.

**Gospel eco efficiency**

This current treats nature as resources that should be managed under cost benefit analysis criterion. To conceptualize the theoretical lack of conflict between growth and the health of the environment, the sustainable development narratives are used. Concepts like dematerialization of the economy or green growth are used often by this current's supporters. Studies that try to legitimize some economic projects do not consider cultural values or traditional knowledge. The result of this is a commoditization of the natural in the form of natural capital, and everything with it being subject to political numericalization, affecting whether one thrives or not. Global capitalism can further expand after the economic evaluation of international organization of conservation groups.

**Environmental justice and racism**

The uneven load place by capitalism of certain social groups and locations, particularly of certain race or ethnicity, give raise to the term environmental racism.  With the obvious existence of exeptions, it still seem obvious that the most interested in make a sustainable explotation of the environment are those whose livelihood depend on, and this is true in normally indigenous and relatively poor regions, where primary sector is almost the only one. It is therefore that the protection of the territory, autonomy and economic sustent, is also the protection of the environment. Environmental justice are environmental justice are hard to separate.

**Why are not comming the movements together?**

It is hard to approximate positions as the financial dependence of the first two groups on large extractive corporations is too large. There is a direct clash on positions that certain projects can be compensated somewhere else, or traded for some other conservationists efforts.

**A deep dive ito the Environmentalism of the Poor, key features**

Environmental Justice demands often include claims linked to recognition and participation

Territorial struggles overlap with environmental struggles. Indigenous peoples appeal to human rights, indigenous territorial rights, human livelihoods, and the sacredness of endangered mountains or rivers, which cannot be accounted for in monetary language and economic compensation.

Among indigenous peoples, the term “territory” refers to ancestral land and has a more all-embracing meaning than land.
Different languages of valuation are deployed side by side such as livelihood, human right to life and health, sacredness and local indigenous territorial rights.

Engaging in direct action with the company and demanding a different structure and space for dialogue and a different form of valuation for their land and the damages.

Indigenous groups are active at scales from local to global and they are helping to introduce new concepts and values

They are also providing an alternative to the uniform transition from underdevelopment to development. 

Considering that if a tribal or rural poor family sees the availability of clean water, fodder, medicinal plants and wood endangered because of a mining project or a dam, the loss cannot be easily compensated for.

Deprived urban neighborhoods tend to get poor environmental services such as green spaces, street cleaning and waste collection while wealthier and white communities enjoy environmental privileges – parks, coasts, open space – in a racially exclusive way.

Today, demands include the right to well-connected, affordable, and clean transit systems in cities

**The Causes of Environmental Conflicts: Undeterred Processes of Development, Growth, and Speculation**

The growth in resource extraction conflicts including biomass (and also waste disposal conflicts, of which the most noticeable one is that arising from the production of an excessive amount of carbon dioxide), is explained by social metabolism.

On the other hand, land is also a matter of private appropriation, speculation, and exploitation, and many of the urban Environmental Justice struggles are not directly related to social metabolic expansion. In cities, processes and threats such as real estate speculation, profit from redevelopment projects, capital accumulation through land use transformation, and gentrification together with urban renewal policies are at the core of many urban conflicts.

 The forces that shape urban (re)development are as much local as global, and support profit seeking at the expense of the expulsion or the marginal and working class.
 
 Consequently, we argue in this paper that such processes explain why the most recent aspect of Environmental Justice mobilization – and maybe, its most fundamental one, – is the defense of the right to place and territory and the right to stay without being displaced.
 
 The Environmentalism of the Poor is thus also the right to remain in one's place and environment and to remain protected from waves of uncontrolled investment, land grabbing, speculatio

**Dicussion and Conclusion**

Environmental Justice is about intragenerational distribution as well as intergenerational distribution. It also refers to non-distributional dimensions of justice such as recognition and avoidance of participatory exclusion.

In many other cases, the poor and indigenous have tried to stop degradation of the environment by defending
their territorial rights or the sacredness of their land. In this paper, we argue that rural and urban actors in such conflicts appeal to local identities, cultural traditions, and to their right to place and place-(re)

In many environmental conflicts, behind the technicalities of applicable legislation, or cost– benefit analysis or environmental impact assessment, there are power struggles within which local valuation languages do not often prevail.
 
The metabolism that drives economic growth causes increased conflicts on environmental resources
and services, extraction and appropriation, waste disposal, and land grabbing. 

In cities, today capitalism, governmental actors, racism, and classism work so well together that they perversely produce environmental gentrification and exclusion through land speculation, revitalization projects, and green initiatives — while also shifting environmental burdens to the most excluded.

Bringing the conservation movement closer to The Environmentalism of the Poor is often difficult, not only
because the conservation movement consorts too closely with the engineers and economists, but also because there are financial links between the extractive industries and this movement. The factual alliance between the Cult of Wilderness and the Gospel of Eco-Efficiency is so far much stronger than the potential alliance between the Cult of Wilderness and the movement for Environmental Justice and The Environmentalism of the Poor.


# Summary of the chapters of the book The Divide: Chapter 4-5  From Colonialism to the Coup

But the Eisenhower administration knew that it would be diffcult to justify attacking a movement that 
was so obviously rooted in the principles of equality, justice and independence. He had to  find a way to get the American public onside. He did it in the end by drawing heavily on Cold War rhetoric: he painted developmentalism as the   rst step on the road to communism, and by connecting developmentalist governments to the USSR he was able to tar them in the minds of American citizens.

Africa is stereotyped as a continent plagued by corrupt dictators, with the supposition 
being that Africans are perhaps too ‘primitive’ to appreciate the virtues of Western- style democracy. But the truth is that ever since the end of colonialism, Africans have been actively prevented from establishing democracies. The legacy of strongman rule in Africa is largely a Western invention, not an indigenous proclivity. Western powers have thwarted countless attempts at real independence, which casts a rather ironic light on the West’s historical image as a beacon of democracy and popular sovereignty.

This is economic ideology came to be known as neoliberalism. It is ‘neo’ in the sense that it revived classical market liberalism from the death it had suffered after the Great Depression, but it also added a  few new elements. The notion that market freedom is tantamount to  individual liberty was a new and distinctive feature of the ideology –   and became central to its political success in the West.And neoliberalism abandoned any pretence to neutrality in favour of a 
more politically charged agenda: it was against subsidies and protections for the working class and regulations that supported unions, but was quite comfortable with subsidies and protections for the rich  and regulations that supported large corporations.

The point to take from this sordid story is that neoliberal economic  policies were so obviously destructive to people’s lives that it was  very difficult to get them implemented in a democratic government. In most cases, the only way to bring them in was through military dictatorship and a state terror programme that would quash resistance wherever it emerged. In order to aggressively deregulate the economy, you   rst have to aggressively regulate the political sphere. Total market freedom requires total political unfreedom, even to the extent of mass imprisonment and concentration camps.

The upper class got their   fix in the form of the ‘Volcker Shock’. Paul 
Volcker, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, argued that the only  way to put an end to in ation was to dramatically raise interest rates,  clamping down on the supply of money in order to recuperate its  value. During the Reagan administration, Volcker jacked up interest  rates from the low single digits to as high as 20 per cent. It is caused 
a massive recession, as it dramatically increased the costs of doing  business. As businesses laid off workers, unemployment rates shot to over 10 per cent. It is decimated the power of organised labour, 
which had been the crucial counterbalance to the excesses that 
had  led to the Great Depression. In sum, the Volcker Shock had devastating effects on the working class. It caused wages to collapse,  and mortgage defaults tripled. But it cured into ation.

Neoliberalism has failed as a tool for 
economic development  –  but it has worked brilliantly as a tool 
for restoring power to the wealthy elite

Under the banner of the Cold War, pro- poor 
legislation was demonised in Western media as ‘communist’, and 
this designation gave Western governments licence to employ even 
the most draconian tactics with impunity. Yet few of the global 
South leaders who were assassinated or deposed during this period 
identi  ed as communist; for the most part, they were explicitly 
 non- aligned, and championed the third way of a Keynesian mixed 
economy. Indeed, they were merely mimicking the policies that the 
US and Europe had used themselves to such great effect. If we dig 
behind the rhetoric, it becomes clear that Western support for 
 right- wing coups had little to do with Cold War ideology, and 
certainly nothing to do with promoting democracy (quite the 
opposite!); the goal, rather, was to defend Western economic 
interests. The veil of the Cold War has obscured this blunt fact 
from view


Developmentalism was not without its flaws. Rapid economic 
growth, industrialisation and ‘modernisation’ came with signi  -
cant costs. In many cases it meant pushing peasant farmers of the 
land in order to make way for bigger, more ‘effcient’ operations. It 
meant displacing communities in order to build dams.  It meant 
drawing people into the labour force for the   first time, making
them dependent on wages for survival and roping them into consumer markets. And it had environmental costs, too, such as soil 
degradation from high- input farming, pollution from power stations and factories, and ecosystem disruption caused by industries like mining and forestry.

Developmentalism was, after all, a Western model. By 
adopting the growth- at- all- costs agenda and by looking to the 
West as the apex of economic achievement, global South countries 
missed their opportunity to chart an alternative trajectory from 
the outset.
