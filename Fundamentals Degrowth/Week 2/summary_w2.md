### Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality

CHAPTER TWO
Race, Class, and the Politics of Place

The South in this latter period was undergoing a number of dramatic demographic. economic, and ecological changes. It had become a major growth center.

Growth in the region during the 1970s was stimulated by a number of factors. They included (12) a climate pleasant enough to attract workers from other regions and the "underemployed" workforce already in the region, (2) weak labor unions and strong right-to-work laws, (3) cheap labor and cheap land, (4) attractive areas for new industries, i.e., electronics, federal defense, and aerospace contracting, (5) aggressive self-promotion and booster campaigns. and (6) lenient environmental regulations

it promoted as important for a "good business climate," including "low business taxes, a good infrastructure of municipal services, vigorous law enforcement, an eager and docile labor force, and a minimum of business regulations

economic boosters could usually count on their promise of jobs as an efficient strategy of neutralizing local opposition to growth projects

people do not speak of growth as useful to profits---rather, they speak of it as necessary for making jobs

Those communities that failed to penetrate the clean industry market were left with a choice of dirty industry or no industry at all. These disparities typify the changing industrial pattern in the South.

The South also has the largest concentration of blacks in the country. In 1980, more than 14 million blacks lived in the region. Blacks were nearly one-fifth of the region's population. In the 1970s the region's black population increased by nearly 18 percent.

*Consequences of Uneven Development*

Migrants to urban areas and incumbent residents who had marginal skills generally found themselves in the growing unemployment lines

Growth in the urban South heightened status differences between rich and poor and between blacks and whites. Poverty coexisted amid affluence. Poverty, however, represented a source of cheap labor.

The New South was promoted as a changed land where blacks could now share in the American Dream. Fuller argued that "power has not changed hands in the South, not from white hands to black hands."[12] What is "new" about an area where blacks are systematically denied access to jobs, housing, and other residential amenities?

Black communities still suffer from institutionalized discrimination. Discriminatory practices occur at various levels of government and affect the location of polling places, municipal landfills, and toxic-waste dumps. 

Black communities still suffer from institutionalized discrimination. Discriminatory practices occur at various levels of government and affect the location of polling places, municipal landfills, and toxic-waste dumps. 

There were twenty-three blacks in the U.S. Congress in 1989. This number represented only 5.3 percent of the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. There were no blacks in the U.S. Senate.

Until these policysetting institutions are made more inclusive, we are likely to find an intensification of locational conflicts and charges of racial discrimination.




*Endangered Environs*

Many black workers must settle for nearby manufacturing jobs---the ones that have not moved out of the inner city. Because of their proximity to polluting industries, black communities have the most to gain from effective environmental enforcement mechanisms.

Social justice, political empowerment, equal education, fair employment practices, and open housing were major goals of social justice advocates. It was one thing to talk about "saving trees" and a whole different story when one talked about "saving low-income housing" for the poor.

Decent and affordable housing became a more salient issue than the traditional environmental issues. Similarly, unemployment and poverty were more pressing social problems for African Americans than any of the issues voiced by middleclass environmentalists.

In their desperate attempt to improve the economic conditions of their constituents, many civil rights advocates, business leaders, and political officials directed their energies toward bringing jobs to their communities by relaxing enforcement of pollution standards and environmental regulations and sometimes looking the other way when violations were discovered. In many instances, the creation of jobs resulted in health risks to workers and residents of the surrounding communities.

Polluting industries were brought into poor communities with little input from local community leaders.[23] When questions were raised by concerned citizens. the argument of jobs for local residents was used to quell dissent. Jobs were real; environmental risks were unknown.

Many industrial firms especially waste disposal companies and industries that have a long history of pollution violations, came to view the black community as a "pushover lacking community organization, environmental consciousness, and with strong and blind pro-business politics."

Because a large share of inhabitants in these communities are renters (many from low-income households) rather than home owners, it is difficult to organize and mobilize residents. This marginality also makes it hard for people to donate their time or money to fend off threats to the community.

*Growing Black Militancy*

Blacks did not launch a frontal assault on environmental problems affecting their communities until these issues were couched in a civil rights context beginning in the early 1980s. They began to treat their struggle for environmental equity as a struggle against institutionalized racism and an extension of the quest for social justice.[37] Just as black citizens fought for equal education, employment, and housing, they began to include the opportunity to live in a healthy environment as part of their basic rights. Moreover, they were convinced that disparate enforcement of environmental policies and regulations contributes to neighborhood decline much like housing discrimination, redlining practices, and residential segregation do.

The site at Afton was not even scientifically the most suitable. The water table of Afton, North Carolina, (site of the landfill) is only 5-10 feet below the surface, and the residents of the community derive all of their drinking water from local wells. Only the most optimistic could believe that the Afton landfill will not eventually leach into the groundwater. The depositing of toxic wastes within the black community is no less than attempted genocide.

Landfilling is cheap. It is cheaper than the alternative. The people who like to use landfills such as chemical industries are very powerful. No amount of science, truth, knowledge or facts goes into making this decision. It is a purely political decision. What they listen to is pressure.


**Waste Facilily Siting Disparities**

The facility siting controversy cannot be reduced solely to a class phenomenon because there is no shortage of poor white communities in the region. One only has to point to southern Appalachia to see widespread white poverty in America. Nevertheless, poor whites along with their more afiluent counterparts have more options and leveraging mechanisms (formal and informal) at their disposal than blacks of equal status.

Nationally, three of the five largest commercial hazardous-waste landfills are located in areas where blacks and Hispanics compose a majority of the population. These siting disparities expose minority citizens to greater risks than the general population.

Growing empirical evidence shows that toxic-waste dumps, municipal landfills, garbage incinerators, and similar noxious facilities are not randomly scattered across the American landscape. The siting process has resulted in minority neighborhoods (regardless of class) carrying a greater burden of localized costs than either affluent or poor white neighborhoods. Differential access to power and decision making found among black and white communities also institutionalizes siting disparities.

Finally, the burden, or negative side, of industrial development has not been equally distributed across all segments of the population. Living conditions in many communities have not improved very much with new growth. Black communities became the dumping grounds for various types of unpopular facilities, including toxic wastes, dangerous chemicals, paper mills, and other polluting industries.

A political strategy is also needed that can draw from a wide cross-section of individuals and groups who share a common interest in preservation of environmental standards. In his keynote address to the 1983 Urban Environment Conference on toxics and minorities, Congressman John Conyers of Detroit pinpointed this strategy. The black congressman saw broad-based groups (e.g., similar to those attending the New Orleans meeting) as having an "opportunity to raise the fairness issue in all dimensions, including the toxic threat to the poor, minority and working class Americans."

Environmental hazards are inequitably distributed in the United States, with poor people and people of color bearing a greater share of pollution
than richer people and white people.

However, since so much of environmental decision making is structured by legal institutions, it is important to understand the way in which environmental laws can both contribute to and mitigate the injustice experienced by many communities.

Understanding environmental racism and injustice requires a broader, structural perspective. This broader perspective, what we call the “political economy”
of environmental racism, is crucial both to framing the issue and to addressing the injustice so many communities experience.

This broader analysis, in turn, forces us to go beyond framing the problem as merely a distributive one—certain communities get an unfair environmental burden—
and to reconceptualize grassroots activism as more than an attempt to disrupt the decisions of private corporations and state agencies. Instead,
grassroots struggles are a crucial arena in which to restructure social relations through systems of localized environmental decision making.

A private company or government official has made the decision to locate an environmentally hazardous facility in their neighborhood.
These processes also involve a community’s decision to organize and become involved in the decisions that shape its lives and health.

**Transformative Politics**

What is “new” about the Environmental Justice Movement is not the “elevated environmental consciousness” of its members but the ways that it transforms the possibilities for fundamental social and environmental change through redefinition, reinvention, and construction of innovative political and cultural
discourses and practices.

Individuals are transformed through the process of struggle by learning about, and participating in, a decision that will fundamentally affect their quality of life. Using lawyers and other technicians, residents in embattled communities both build upon their knowledge of their community’s environmental problems and acquire knowledge about the substantive and procedural aspects of environmental decision making. Their home-grown, and acquired, expertise empowers local residents and helps them to develop a grassroots base to influence environmental decision making.

Environmental justice groups are networking with other groups to provide information and technical expertise to grassroots constituencies on various issues of interest to disenfranchised communities, beyond environmental justice. Because of these networks, residents in marginal communities will continue to shape environmental policy, both locally and nationally, as well as create more opportunities for community input into the spectrum of policy making that affects their material conditions.

**Words Have Power: A Note on Our Terminology**

“environmental racism” and “environmental injustice” interchangeably in the book. While “environmental racism” is the better-known term, “environmental injustice” is broader and encompasses both the racial and the class aspects of the political economy at work in communities that face toxic assault.

Environmental justice requires democratic decision making, community empowerment, and the incorporation of social structure.

Most important in our concept of environmental justice is the element of democratic decision making, or community self-determination. Current environmental decision-making processes have not been effective in providing meaningful participation opportunities for those most burdened by environmental decisions.

Historically, poor communities of color have been marginalized within the environmental movement. These communities view traditional environmentalism as associated with the preservation of wildlife and wilderness—concerns that are just not central to the everyday survival of poor communities and communities of color.


**A Final Note: The Focus on Waste**

The movement for environmental justice seeks much more than merely to stop the siting of waste facilities, and other locally undesirable land uses
in low-income communities and communities of color. Waste facility siting battles are but one aspect of the movement for environmental justice,
which also concerns itself with the cleanup of contaminated industrial sites, the elimination of occupational hazards, lead abatement, enforcement of existing environmental regulations, and the guarantee of representation in the environmental decision-making process.

The movement for environmental justice is also about creating clean jobs, building a sustainable economy, guaranteeing safe and affordable housing, and achieving racial and social justice.

Waste facility siting is also the arena in which a great deal of grassroots action takes place. It is no coincidence that some of the first major environmental justice studies to chart disproportionate impact focused on commercial waste facilities. These facilities can pose great risk to human health and the environment and are the subject of ongoing public scrutiny and concern.

# A History of the Environmental Justice Movement

Perhaps the most significant source feeding into today’s Environmental
Justice Movement is the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s, 1960s,
and 1970s. Through that movement, hundreds of thousands of African
Americans and their allies, primarily but not solely in the southern
United States, pressed for social change and experienced empowerment
through grassroots activism

Environmental Justice Movement leaders coming out of civil rights
organizing include not only those who advocated for the rights of
African Americans but also Latino activists. 

Civil rights activists brought three things to the Environmental Justice Movement: a history of, and experience with, direct action, which
led to similar exercises of grassroots power by the Environmental Justice
Movement; a perspective that recognized that the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards was not random or the result of “neutral”
decisions but a product of the same social and economic structure which
had produced de jure and de facto segregation and other racial oppression; and the experience of empowerment through political action


1960s, introduced the Environmental Justice Act.8
Though the Act did not pass Congress, it raised environmental justice issues to a new stature in Washington. Lewis, in speaking about the bill,
recognized that “the quest for environmental justice has helped to renew
the civil rights movement” through its call for environmental protection
as a “right of all, not a privilege for a few

The second major tributary to the river is the grassroots anti-toxics
movement. Communities have long resisted and organized against hazardous waste facilities, landfills, and incinerators.

 Growing out of their concrete experiences in their own communities, anti-toxics activists came up with the
idea of “pollution prevention”—that is, eliminating the use of toxic
chemicals in industrial practices so that the production of toxic waste
is stopped as well. 

the Environmental Justice Movement. It further contributed both the experience of
using (and, when need be, discrediting) scientific and technical information and the conceptual framework that pushed pollution prevention and
toxics use reduction as policy goals.

**Academics**

Academics,
however, have played a crucial role in both sparking and shaping the Environmental Justice Movement, perhaps a larger one than they have
played in any other broad-based social movement in the United States

Beyond lobbying the federal government, the academics researched
and wrote (and continue to produce) studies that demonstrate the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color and
on low-income people.

the academics have provided expertise to community
groups during litigation or administrative advocacy in a local environmental justice struggle

the academics learned from community
residents the situation on the ground, while local residents came to understand their community’s struggle in the context of a larger regional
or national pattern and movement


**Native American Struggles**
Native American activists brought to the Environmental Justice
Movement the experiences of centuries of struggle for self-determination and resistance to resource-extractive land use.


The Native American tributary to the movement also helped define
one of its central philosophies, the concept of self-determination. The
centuries-old Native American idea of sovereignty echoed with, and
helped create, the Environmental Justice Movement’s credo, “We speak
for ourselves.”

**The Labor Movement**

the historical struggle of farm-workers to gain control over their
working conditions. The farm-worker movement of the 1960s, led by
Cesar Chavez, was perhaps the first nationally known effort by people
of color to address an environmental issue. Much of the activity took
the form of union organizing drives.

Unionization and protection of
farm-workers’ health and safety were integrally linked from the earliest
days of the farm-worker organizing drives

A second, and much less significant, labor tributary, one fed by the
public health activism of the 1970s, is the occupational safety and health
movement. The rise of Committees on Occupational Safety and Health
(COSHs) across the country in the 1970s and 1980s brought increased
attention to the environmental hazards faced by workers in the workplace.

A third labor tributary is the increased attention paid to occupational
safety and health by industrial unions. Led by sometimes renegade union
activists such as Tony Mazzochi, unions such as the Oil, Chemical, and
Atomic Workers Union have paid increased attention to environmental
justice issues.
