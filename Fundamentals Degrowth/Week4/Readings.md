# The anti-colonial politics of degrowth - paper summary

* Decarbonization cannot be accomplished fast enough to respect Paris targets as long as
energy use in the global North remains so high

* Production should be organized instead around human needs and sufficiency, enabling people
to pursue the “art of living nobly” rather than “a complicated material life based on high speed”

* Degrowth scholarship and activism is aligned with these movements, with demands directed specifically at the North. It is the sharp edge of anti-colonial struggle within the metropole. 

* Degrowth scholarship points out that energy and resource use in high-income nations is vastly in excess of what is required to end poverty and to
deliver high levels of wellbeing for all, including universal public healthcare, education, transportation, computing, communication, housing, and healthy food

* What degrowth adds is the assertion that growth in high-income nations is not required in order to achieve a flourishing society. What is required is justice. Recognizing this is part of building class consciousness against the ideology of capital

*  Ecosocialism without anti-imperialism is not an ecosocialism worth having. And in the face of ecological breakdown,
solidarity with the South requires degrowth in the North.

# Quantifying national responsibility for climate breakdown: an equality-based attribution approach for carbon dioxide emissions in excess of the planetary boundary

National contributions to cumulative CO2 emissions in excess of the planetary boundary of 350 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration. This approach is rooted in the principle of equal per capita access to atmospheric commons.

The Global North was responsible for 92%. By contrast, most countries in the Global South were within their boundary fair shares, including India and China.

High-income countries have a greater degree of responsibility for climate damages than previous methods have implied. These results offer a just framework for attributing national responsibility for excess emissions


# Colonial dimensions of ecological breakdown (class notes)

* Weare heading to at least 3 degrees global warming,which means 1-2 meters of sea level rise (islands and poor cities heavily threatened), ~50% species extinction , 1.5 billion of displacement, crop collapse (likely famines), breaking most planetary boundaries.

* Capiloscene is better than Antropocene to explain the root cause behind human system induce climate change

* 30 GJ per capita is compatible with 1.5 degree

* Decarbonization is much easier on lower consumption of energy, due to the required amount to infraestucture change and requirements for large scale renewable energy transition.

* Aggregate high level of energy may not reach necessary consumption due to massive inequality and also unequal exchange

* Energy use in the high income countries is on the aggregate way higher, around 6-7 times higher than the 30gj/people required
* There is a cummulative appropiation of the commons of the atmosphere of 90% from the North, while 90% of the costs go to the North and 98% of the deaths
* As of 2015, most countries in Africa, Latin America and South Asia are within their fair share.
