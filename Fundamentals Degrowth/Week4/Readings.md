# The anti-colonial politics of degrowth

* Decarbonization cannot be accomplished fast enough to respect Paris targets as long as
energy use in the global North remains so high

* Production should be organized instead around human needs and sufficiency, enabling people
to pursue the “art of living nobly” rather than “a complicated material life based on high speed”

* Degrowth scholarship and activism is aligned with these movements, with demands directed specifically at the North. It is the sharp edge of anti-colonial struggle within the metropole. 

* Degrowth scholarship points out that energy and resource use in high-income nations is vastly in excess of what is required to end poverty and to
deliver high levels of wellbeing for all, including universal public healthcare, education, transportation, computing, communication, housing, and healthy food

* What degrowth adds is the assertion that growth in high-income nations is not required in order to achieve a flourishing society. What is required is justice. Recognizing this is part of building class consciousness against the ideology of capital

*  Ecosocialism without anti-imperialism is not an ecosocialism worth having. And in the face of ecological breakdown,
solidarity with the South requires degrowth in the North.
