## Class 1.1 – Introduction to Degrowth: what is it and where does it come from?

### What is Degrowth? From an Activist Slogan to a Social Movement

##**Definitions**##

* missile word that sparks a debate of our society, repolitizing desired socio environmental futures
* it is a slogan agains economic growth and green growth, breaking with the false consensus of sustainable development
* in economics, one of the fundations was the work of Hermann Daly on the Steady State Economics
* degrowth is not focused only on economics, rather a system of ideas and values. It claims that some social and environmental crisis are related to economic growth.
* does not embrace one single philosophical current

##**Sources**##


**Ecology**

*Ecosystems have value in themselves

*Stresses the competition between ecosystems and the industrial production and consumption systems
Degrowth is therefore a possible path to preserve ecosystems by the reduction of human pressure over ecosystems and
nature, and a challenge to the idea that decoupling of ecological impacts from economic growth is possible



**Critiques of development and praise for anti-utilitarianism**

*Critique of the uniformisation of cultures due to the widespread adoption of particular technologies and consumption and production models experienced in the global North

*Critique of homo economicus, against utility-maximisation as the ultimate driving force of human behaviour.

*Degrowth in that sense calls for more ample visions giving importance to economic relations based on gifts and reciprocity, where social relations and conviviality (connecting autonomously with the environment) are central

**Meaning of life and well-being**

*Critique of life-styles based on the mantras of working more, earning more, selling more and buying more.

*Voluntary simplicity, reducing individual consumption while seeing simple life as liberating and profound rather than restraining and limiting is an important vision within this source

**Bioeconomics**

* For Georgescu Roegen, human activity transforms energy and materials of low entropy or good quality into waste and pollution which are unusable and have high entropy. Even the inlow of low-entropy solar energy is limited in the
sense that it falls in a dispersed fashion on the earth. 

* Degrowth can thus slow down the process of material degradation, as a steady state economy is not enough in Western Countries

* The decreasing energy return on investment and the imminent peak oil, are often cited in academic and political debate

* The financial system confuses expansion of credit with the creation of real wealth, while the real economy of
energy and materials cannot grow at the interest rate necessary to pay off debts.

* While technological innovation is a source of debate in degrowth, all degrowth actors question the capacity of technological innovation to overcome biophysical limits and sustain ininite economic growth.

* Degrowth dwells on many ‘non-technical’ proposals for reducing material and energy usage outside the modernisation approach which tends to discard the option of setting some limits to technologies

* Jevons paradox indicates that eco-efficiency may lead to increased consumption or production because technologies suppress limits

**Democracy**

* Response to the lack of democratic debates on economic development, growth, technological innovation and advancement

* It is a open debate whether current institutions ought to be kept

* "Democracy can only exist by (and with) self-"

**Justice**

* social comparison based on the existence and promotion of rich-people lifestyles, has been responsible for social and environmental crises. Setting a maximum income, or maximum wealth, to weaken envy as a motor of consumerism.

* It intentionally pursues and explores ways to make justice and sustainability compatible.

* Degrowth opts for less competition, large scale redistribution, sharing and reduction of excessive incomes. If poverty is perceived in terms of relative consumption, it can never be ‘eradicated’ by economic growth as it only changes the scale but not the proportions of wealth which individuals possess

* Justice requires a degrowth of the living standards of the rich classes of the North and South

* Repairing past injustice. A good illustration is the concept of ecological debt, or the demand that the Global North pays for past and present colonial exploitation in the Global South

* The equality approach to justice in the context of degrowth implies resource and wealth redistribution both within and between North and South economies. Justice here is understood as a concern for a fair distribution of economic, social and environmental goods and bads at all time-lines

* Finally, some understand justice as preventing misery by establishing minimum standards and a basic income for all.

* Others challenge the basic income approach and underline the importance of merit and contribution to society

## Strategies and actors

* Some actors call for a complete overhaul of the existing institutions, while others call for their transformation or partial conservation at both local and higher levels

* Degrowth actors are often engaged in oppositional activism such as campaigners working to stop the expansion of highways, airports, high speed trains and other infrastructures.

* Practitioners on the other hand promote local, decentralised, small scale and participatory alternatives such as cycling, reuse, vegetarianism or veganism, co-housing, agro-ecology, eco-villages, solidarity economy, consumer cooper-
atives, alternative (so called ethical) banks or credit cooperatives, decentralised renewable energy cooperatives.

* The major idea being if less time is spent on formal work and consumption, more time can be dedicated to other activities
which are fundamental to one’s well-being, such as social relations, political participation, physical exercise, spirituality and contemplation. Such a shift will potentially be less environmentally harmful.

* Latouche (2009) we are living not only in a growth economy, but in a growth society. Therefore degrowth implies a societal transformation. While many actors oppose or challenge some institutions, they often propose to
act within existing ones.

* Some institutions need to be defended, like some form of social security and public health, public kindergarten and schools

* For Martinez-Alier et al. (2011) degrowth is actually an example of activist-led science.

* Much more research on what type of degrowth, and how much of it, is needed. Doubt is cast on whether the final outcome will still be a capitalist economy and society or not

* There is awareness that action must be taken on all levels. Most activities take place at the local scale, and are often articulated through informal and formal networks.

* The movement is still far from being able to coordinate actions to reduce absolute consumption of energy and materials at the national and global scale.

* It remains unclear how the socio-ecological transformation might actually take place at macro scales and which institutions should be involved.

## Discussion
* The classification of sources presented in this article for analytical
purposes should not be seen as implying hermetic compartments.

* The overview of streams of thought feeding into the river of the degrowth movement is not exhaustive. Feminism, political ecology, non-violence... are part of it too

* Some followers of Marx have argued that degrowth does not explicitly or sufficiently position itself against capitalism

* Complexity and multi-dimensionality of degrowth can sometimes be difficult to communicate, and overwhelming to people looking for a single guide to practical action.

* Improving democracy or justice without worrying about meaning of life could lead us to techno-centred solutions.

* The debates and controversies over strategies employed within each source of the degrowth movement have been most intense.

* For Latouche (2009) degrowth is not a concrete and universal alternative to growth, but a matrix of multiple alter-
natives that will reopen the space for human creativity, after removal of the plaster of economic totalitarianism.

* The eventual success story of degrowth in the media, academia and society could actually be related to the good variety
of strategies within degrowth.

## Degrowth actors

* new middle class plays an important role
* new social movements, together with all ones joining forces against structural conflicts
* scientists, activists and practitioners

## Conclusions

Generally degrowth challenges the hegemony of growth and calls for a democratically led redistributive downscaling of production and consumption in industrialised countries as a means to achieve environmental sustainability, social justice and well-being.

Thus degrowth is neither a mere criticism of economic growth, nor a proposal for a decrease of GDP.

Finally, degrowth is an example of an activist-led science, where an activist slogan is slowly consolidating into a concept that can be analysed and discussed in the academic arena.

### Kallis what is degrowth?

Experts accumulate power at the expense of
people. Illich’s slogan was that socialism can then only arrive by bicycle. A
complex technological system cannot be democratic or egalitarian

# Class Notes 2nd November 2022

**What is Degrowth - summary from Giorgios Kallis

* A critique of the desirability of economic growth. It is a slogan that challenges the hegemony of growth.

* A voluntary shrinking of production and consumption in industrialized countries aimed at ecological sustainability, social justice and well being

* An egalitarian social transformaton where the energy use, material and waste decreases while welfare improves

* Serge Latouche Rs Degrowth: Reevaluate, Reconceptualize, Restructure, Redistribute, Relocalize, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

* Degrowth is a frame for a social movement that puts a the center of the problems the pursue of growth

* Is degrowth a movement or a community? Does it have the scale to be called a movement? 


**Where did degrowth come from?

* Key milestones: Limits to growth, Andre Gorz, Georgscu-Roegen, Serge Latouche...

* Sources:  environmentalism, ecological ecomics, post development, autonomy, social justice


*Questions of the session*

Assuming degrowth is successfully implemented in a diverse set of ways, reducing also its military and technological efforts. Wouldn't we have the same fate as  indigenous communities in america, or Tibet?


# Class 1.2 Appropriation in the colonial world economy

## Summary of Chapter 1 from the book Less is More - "Capitalism a Creation Story" 

* 97% of that time our ancestors lived in relative harmony with the Earth’s ecosystems

*  Our crisis has nothing to do with humans as such. It has to do with the dominance of a particular economic
system: one that is recent in origin, which developed in particular places at a particular time in history, and which has not been adopted to the same extent by all societies. As the sociologist Jason Moore has pointed out, this isn’t the Anthropocene it’s the Capitalocene.

* While markets have been around for many thousands of years, in di erent times and places, capitalism is relatively recent

* The goal of capital is to extract and accumulate surplus, it has to get these things for as cheap as
possible. In other words, capital works according to a simple, straightforward formula: take more – from nature and from
labour – than you give back

*  Capitalism didn’t just ‘emerge’. There was no smooth, natural ‘transition’ to capitalism, and it has nothing to do with human nature.

* It wasn’t the rise of capitalism that put an end to feudalism. That at victory belongs, remarkably enough, to a courageous
struggle fought by a long tradition of everyday revolutionaries who have for some reason been almost entirely forgotten.

* Due to the relative abundance of land and limited labor, Commoners began to realise that this was their
chance: they had an opportunity to change the very foundations of the social and political order.  ey grew more hopeful, more confident, and the rebellions gained steam.

* Wages rose to levels higher than ever before in recorded history, doubling or even tripling in most regions and in some cases rising as much a s sixfold.Rents declined, food became cheap, and nutrition improved. Workers were able to bargain for shorter working hours and weekends off , plus benefits like meals on the job and payment for each mile they had to travel to and from work.

* Once they won direct control of the land, free peasants were able to maintain a more reciprocal relationship with nature: they managed pastures and commons collectively, through democratic assemblies, with careful rules that regulated tillage, grazing and forest use.

* We often assume that capitalism emerged somehow naturally from the collapse of feudalism, but in fact
such a transition would have been impossible. Capitalism requires elite accumulation: piling up excess wealth for large-scale investment. But the egalitarian conditions of post- feudalist society –  self- sufficiency, high wages, grassroots democracy and collective management of resources –  were inimical to the possibility of elite accumulation. Indeed, this is exactly what elites were complaining about. 


* Economists have always recognised that some kind of  initial accumulation was necessary for the rise of capitalism. Adam Smith called this ‘previous accumulation’, and claimed that it came about because a few people worked really
hard and saved their earnings  –  an idyllic tale that still gets repeated in economics textbooks. But historians see it as
naïve.  This was no innocent process of saving. It was a process of plunder. Karl Marx insisted on calling it ‘primitive accumulation’, to highlight the barbaric nature of the violence it
entailed.

* From the 1500s to the 1700s real wages declined by as much as 70%.Nutrition deteriorated and starvation became
commonplace

*  The First century of the Industrial Revolution was characterised by a striking deterioration in life expectancy, down to levels not seen since the Black Death in the fourteenth century. 

### Growth as colonisation

In the decades that inaugurated the rise of capitalism, enclosure and colonisation were deployed as part of the same strategy.

Colonialism and expropiation provided some of the surplus that ended up invested in the Industrial Revolution; it enabled the purchase of land- based goods from the East, which allowed Europe to shifts population from agriculture to industrial production; and it funded the military expansion that powered further rounds of colonial conquest.

Colonisation also provided the key raw materials that fuelled the Industrial Revolution.


Colonial mining, logging, and plantation monoculture caused ecological damage on a scale that
was, up to that point, historically unprecedented.

The rise of capitalism in Europe –  and Europe’s Industrial Revolution –  did not emerge ex nihilo. It hinged on commodities that were produced by enslaved workers, on lands stolen from colonised peoples, and processed in factories staffed by European peasants

Under capitalism, growth always requires new frontiers from which to extract uncompensated value. It is, in other words, intrinsically colonial in character.

By destroying self- suffcient economies, they created not only a mass of workers but also a mass of consumers –  people wholly dependent on capital for food, clothes and other essential goods.


### The paradox of artificial scarcity

So to retain their access to land peasants had to devise ways to intensify their production, working longer
hours and extracting more from the soil each year. Those who fell behind in this race would lose their tenancy rights and face starvation. This is put peasants in direct competition with one another, with their own kin and neighbours, transforming what had been a system of collective co-operation into one organised around desperate antagonism.

Faced with the constant threat of replacement, workers were under pressure to produce as much as was physically possible; they regularly worked for sixteen hours a day, significantly longer than they had worked prior to enclosure.

Any increase in total output, he said, was a contribution to the ‘greater good’ –  the betterment of humanity.
The same logic was used to justify colonisation.

None of the gains from the surge in labour productivity went back to the workers themselves; indeed, wages declined during the enclosure period. 

The emergence of the extraordinary productive capacity that characterises capitalism depended on creating and maintaining conditions of artificial scarcity. Scarcity –  and the threat of hunger –  served as the engine of capitalist growth. The  scarcity was artificial in the sense that there was no actual deficit of resources: all the same land and forests and waters remained, just as they always had, but people’s access to them was suddenly restricted.

 It is the source of wealth, since without poverty, there could be no labour; there could be no riches,
no refinement, no comfort, and no benefit to those who may be possessed of wealth.

 The proponents of capitalism themselves believed it was necessary to impoverish people in order to generate growth.




# Notes on the class 3rd November

* Capitalism is not natural
* Countries with lower GDP do not need to catch up
* Countries with lower GDP are ask to develop capitalist markets to catch up
* Defenders of capitalism do not stablish the necessary connection between the wealth of the north and colonialism & imperialism
* Capitalism is the mutation of feudalism, not its liberator
* Peasants revolutions happened already in 1200 in England, France and Germany, improving the living conditions of them and reduce the extractive rents to lords
* The Black Plague exarcerbate the barganing power of peasants, and hence the elite wish to backlash, in the process called Enclosure.
* The Enclosure is an extremely violtent process to avoid peasants to thrive and even live
* The Enclosure creates a massive migration and the expansion of the concept of poverty and scarcity
* Enclosure was an effort to push wages down as it make previous autonomous peasant unemployed and unproductive
* Capitalism is not democratic, even if implemented in a democratic country, as the decision of what to produce are made by a few
* Capitalism is organized on increasing levels of production or growth
* Growth is used for profit seeking, not to improve any social wellbeing
* Capital accumulation requires rising input usages and cheapening of such inputs
* The accumulation of capital requires an imperial arrangement
* The purpose of surplus this time is not to be consumed by rather to expand the accumulation
* Silver was a key expropiated mineral from Andes to Europe to get land from the East. It was for free as slave labor was used, also for Sugar as a crucial source of key calories. Cheap food allows you for cheap labor.
* Cotton was also a key raw material to support the industrial revolution.
* As cheap food was imported, that enable the expansion of specialization and the so called development achieved today
* Breaking subsistence economies, the commons and unfair taxation were essential to ensure a "voluntary" movement of peasants to proletariat
* Degrowth should eliminate artificial scarcity to break the mandate of growth
* To justify violence you need to recall that capitalism is a "natural" phenomenon, and break with the idea of animism, or value and respect of all forms of live
* Casting nature as disordered, chaotic...needed of domination and slaved (Francis Bacon) , nature is a lifeless machine
* Dehumanizing or making other living things as mindless and not really alived
* Only humans are subjects, nature is an object
* This ideology against the nature world allow the consideration os humans as masters and ultimate possesors of nature
* Nature is defined as external to humans, from animist to dualist, showed in economics in the form of externalities /resources/raw materials /ecosystem services / the environment... nature, the ultimate commodity
*
