## Class 1 – Introduction to Degrowth: what is it and where does it come from?

### What is Degrowth? From an Activist Slogan to a Social Movement

##**Definitions**##

* missile word that sparks a debate of our society, repolitizing desired socio environmental futures
* it is a slogan agains economic growth and green growth, breaking with the false consensus of sustainable development
* in economics, one of the fundations was the work of Hermann Daly on the Steady State Economics
* degrowth is not focused only on economics, rather a system of ideas and values. It claims that some social and environmental crisis are related to economic growth.
* does not embrace one single philosophical current

##**Sources**##


**Ecology**

*Ecosystems have value in themselves

*Stresses the competition between ecosystems and the industrial production and consumption systems
Degrowth is therefore a possible path to preserve ecosystems by the reduction of human pressure over ecosystems and
nature, and a challenge to the idea that decoupling of ecological impacts from economic growth is possible



**Critiques of development and praise for anti-utilitarianism**

*Critique of the uniformisation of cultures due to the widespread adoption of particular technologies and consumption and production models experienced in the global North

*Critique of homo economicus, against utility-maximisation as the ultimate driving force of human behaviour.

*Degrowth in that sense calls for more ample visions giving importance to economic relations based on gifts and reciprocity, where social relations and conviviality (connecting autonomously with the environment) are central

**Meaning of life and well-being**

*Critique of life-styles based on the mantras of working more, earning more, selling more and buying more.

*Voluntary simplicity, reducing individual consumption while seeing simple life as liberating and profound rather than restraining and limiting is an important vision within this source

**Bioeconomics**

* For Georgescu Roegen, human activity transforms energy and materials of low entropy or good quality into waste and pollution which are unusable and have high entropy. Even the inlow of low-entropy solar energy is limited in the
sense that it falls in a dispersed fashion on the earth. 

* Degrowth can thus slow down the process of material degradation, as a steady state economy is not enough in Western Countries

* The decreasing energy return on investment and the imminent peak oil, are often cited in academic and political debate

* The financial system confuses expansion of credit with the creation of real wealth, while the real economy of
energy and materials cannot grow at the interest rate necessary to pay off debts.

* While technological innovation is a source of debate in degrowth, all degrowth actors question the capacity of technological innovation to overcome biophysical limits and sustain ininite economic growth.

* Degrowth dwells on many ‘non-technical’ proposals for reducing material and energy usage outside the modernisation approach which tends to discard the option of setting some limits to technologies

* Jevons paradox indicates that eco-efficiency may lead to increased consumption or production because technologies suppress limits

**Democracy**

* Response to the lack of democratic debates on economic development, growth, technological innovation and advancement

* It is a open debate whether current institutions ought to be kept

* "Democracy can only exist by (and with) self-"

**Justice**

* social comparison based on the existence and promotion of rich-people lifestyles, has been responsible for social and environmental crises. Setting a maximum income, or maximum wealth, to weaken envy as a motor of consumerism.

* It intentionally pursues and explores ways to make justice and sustainability compatible.

* Degrowth opts for less competition, large scale redistribution, sharing and reduction of excessive incomes. If poverty is perceived in terms of relative consumption, it can never be ‘eradicated’ by economic growth as it only changes the scale but not the proportions of wealth which individuals possess

* Justice requires a degrowth of the living standards of the rich classes of the North and South

* Repairing past injustice. A good illustration is the concept of ecological debt, or the demand that the Global North pays for past and present colonial exploitation in the Global South

* The equality approach to justice in the context of degrowth implies resource and wealth redistribution both within and between North and South economies. Justice here is understood as a concern for a fair distribution of economic, social and environmental goods and bads at all time-lines

* Finally, some understand justice as preventing misery by establishing minimum standards and a basic income for all.

* Others challenge the basic income approach and underline the importance of merit and contribution to society

## Strategies and actors

* Some actors call for a complete overhaul of the existing institutions, while others call for their transformation or partial conservation at both local and higher levels

* Degrowth actors are often engaged in oppositional activism such as campaigners working to stop the expansion of highways, airports, high speed trains and other infrastructures.

* Practitioners on the other hand promote local, decentralised, small scale and participatory alternatives such as cycling, reuse, vegetarianism or veganism, co-housing, agro-ecology, eco-villages, solidarity economy, consumer cooper-
atives, alternative (so called ethical) banks or credit cooperatives, decentralised renewable energy cooperatives.

* The major idea being if less time is spent on formal work and consumption, more time can be dedicated to other activities
which are fundamental to one’s well-being, such as social relations, political participation, physical exercise, spirituality and contemplation. Such a shift will potentially be less environmentally harmful.

* Latouche (2009) we are living not only in a growth economy, but in a growth society. Therefore degrowth implies a societal transformation. While many actors oppose or challenge some institutions, they often propose to
act within existing ones.

* Some institutions need to be defended, like some form of social security and public health, public kindergarten and schools

* For Martinez-Alier et al. (2011) degrowth is actually an example of activist-led science.

* Much more research on what type of degrowth, and how much of it, is needed. Doubt is cast on whether the final outcome will still be a capitalist economy and society or not

* There is awareness that action must be taken on all levels. Most activities take place at the local scale, and are often articulated through informal and formal networks.

* The movement is still far from being able to coordinate actions to reduce absolute consumption of energy and materials at the national and global scale.

* It remains unclear how the socio-ecological transformation might actually take place at macro scales and which institutions should be involved.

## Discussion
* The classification of sources presented in this article for analytical
purposes should not be seen as implying hermetic compartments.

* The overview of streams of thought feeding into the river of the degrowth movement is not exhaustive. Feminism, political ecology, non-violence... are part of it too

* Some followers of Marx have argued that degrowth does not explicitly or sufficiently position itself against capitalism

* Complexity and multi-dimensionality of degrowth can sometimes be difficult to communicate, and overwhelming to people looking for a single guide to practical action.

* Improving democracy or justice without worrying about meaning of life could lead us to techno-centred solutions.

* The debates and controversies over strategies employed within each source of the degrowth movement have been most intense.

* For Latouche (2009) degrowth is not a concrete and universal alternative to growth, but a matrix of multiple alter-
natives that will reopen the space for human creativity, after removal of the plaster of economic totalitarianism.

* The eventual success story of degrowth in the media, academia and society could actually be related to the good variety
of strategies within degrowth.

## Degrowth actors

* new middle class plays an important role
* new social movements, together with all ones joining forces against structural conflicts
* scientists, activists and practitioners

## Conclusions

Generally degrowth challenges the hegemony of growth and calls for a democratically led redistributive downscaling of production and consumption in industrialised countries as a means to achieve environmental sustainability, social justice and well-being.

Thus degrowth is neither a mere criticism of economic growth, nor a proposal for a decrease of GDP.

Finally, degrowth is an example of an activist-led science, where an activist slogan is slowly consolidating into a concept that can be analysed and discussed in the academic arena.

### Kallis what is degrowth?

Experts accumulate power at the expense of
people. Illich’s slogan was that socialism can then only arrive by bicycle. A
complex technological system cannot be democratic or egalitarian

# Class Notes 2nd November 2022

**What is Degrowth - summary from Giorgios Kallis

* A critique of the desirability of economic growth. It is a slogan that challenges the hegemony of growth.

* A voluntary shrinking of production and consumption in industrialized countries aimed at ecological sustainability, social justice and well being

* An egalitarian social transformaton where the energy use, material and waste decreases while welfare improves

* Serge Latouche Rs Degrowth: Reevaluate, Reconceptualize, Restructure, Redistribute, Relocalize, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

* Degrowth is a frame for a social movement that puts a the center of the problems the pursue of growth

* Is degrowth a movement or a community? Does it have the scale to be called a movement? 


**Where did degrowth come from?

* Key milestones: Limits to growth, Andre Gorz, Georgscu-Roegen, Serge Latouche...

* Sources:  environmentalism, ecological ecomics, post development, autonomy, social justice


*Questions of the session*

Assuming degrowth is successfully implemented in a diverse set of ways, reducing also its military and technological efforts. Wouldn't we have the same fate as  indigenous communities in america, or Tibet?
