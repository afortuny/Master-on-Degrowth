# The Case Of Degrowth (Class notes)

* Scaping from competition and invidualism to common good and simply living
* Engage into the community instead of focusing on only individual impacts
* Coevolutionary possibilities - networks can accelerate the implementation of bootom up innitiatives
* Common that are already here: getting back to the community exchanges : baby sitting, banks of time...
* The cooperative network in bcn is very trong and diverse in coverging banking, food, energy...
* Degrowth requires to network and engage into bottom up innitiatives that revaluate the commons and generate new ways of organize and create prosperity.
* Commons are well organize in small communities, do not need central goverment ruling.
* As commons scale, the conflict with the capitalism system and requires politicing its actions to survive.
* In Barcelona, the generation of cooperative economies, networks against inequality such as the one against house speculation. 
* Once goverments have influence, more spaces are created for cooperative economies.
* Those who claim individual and pure meritocracy are the same who are strongly organized

# Sacrifice Green Zones (Class notes)

* Degrowth is not a principle heavily adopted in GND, even in South groups
* Many of the movements blame consumerism as the driver for sacrifice zones
* Cost Shifting is endogenous to the system, successfully cheapening the inputs.

# Structural adjustment and unequal exchange
* need to write a blogspot related to our course: ideas - How I will explain economic history to my daughter 
* 1st part of the course: growth and imperalism goes together, europe industrialization required the economic submission of the south
* 2nd part the imperial order collapsed, due to the anti colonial movement
* Today we will cover what means that some countries depend on structural demands from IMF compromising its economic sovereneity
* the WTO was responsible since 1995 for breaking any trade protection of the economies of the South
* the size of the economy conditions bargaining power, even ifeach country has one vote
* the green room is what key decisions were taken without "developing countries"
* Most subsisidies and tariffs are prohibited and consider market unfair
* The apparent equally level playing field actual happens with countries that are at very different of industrial development
* In practice, big economies are breaking the rules with impunity, while poor countries are mercilessly sued
* The price gap ration between the north and the south keep expanding since we have records, with the exeption of China
* These price inequality provides an unequal exchange and make wellfare gaps to remain high
* We can show empirically the massive ratios of emboddied work, land and resources shipped to the north due to unequal exchange
* Debt interest are further expanding the unequal exchange of goods and resources
* The unequal exchange is sufficient to provide energy for almost all population to live decently, instead it is used for an elite residing in the north
* It is also sufficient to provide food for 7 billion people, but it is used instead for sugar for energy drinks and cotton for the fast fashion industry
* Net appropiation is so large that is almost entirely responsible for the increase in consumption observed recently
* The amount of expropiation due to unequal exchange is estimate to end extreme poverty 70 times
* The end of poverty does not require growth, requires and end to unequal exchange
* Poor countries are sending the equivalent of a 30:1 in the "aid" they receive
* Poverty can be eradicated with fair exchange terms

# Social Metabolism, Ecological Distribution Conflicts, and Languages of Valuation (paper summary)

* Several studies show that in contrast of the assumption, the poor at equally if not more concern about the environment
* Environmental problems are often a threat to material welfare
*  traditional Left in southern countries still tends to see environmentalism as a ‘‘luxury of the rich,’’
*  The poor, because of their direct reliance on natural resources outside the market, are often careful environmental managers
*  most significant beneficiaries of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services are the poor, and the predominant impact of a loss or denial of these inputs is on
the well-being of the poor
* This does not imply that poor people are always on the side of conservation,
which would be patently untrue. What it means is that in many conflicts of resource
extraction or pollution, the local poor people (indigenous or not) are often on the
side of conservation not so much because they are self-conscious environmentalists
but because of their livelihood needs and their cultural values
* MEFA is a set of methods for describing and analyzing socio-economic
metabolism. It examines economies as systems that reproduce themselves not only
socially and culturally, but also physically through a continuous exchange of energy and
matter with their natural environments and with other socio-economic systems.
* Economists, however, did not adopt a socio-metabolic view. Are economic
historians intellectual servants of the economists? In any case, there was no
economic-environmental historiography counting the flows of energy and
materials.
